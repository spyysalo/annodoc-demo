### Class: classifier

Classification of named entities (token-based, no nesting of entities
etc.) and terms. On one hand, this is pretty universal; on the other
hand, most of us would probably see it as a separate level of
annotation. There are treebanks where the FEAT column contains this
information but they are rare: I saw it in the Czech CoNLL 2006 & 2007
& 2009 data, and in one tagset for Japanese.

### Values for named entities: geo, prs, giv, sur, nat, com, pro, oth

### Values for terms: col, sci, che, med, tec, cel, gov, jus, fin, env, cul, spo, hob
