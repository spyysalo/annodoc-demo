### Definition

A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or
part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object.

Note that `PROPN` is only used for the subclass of nouns that are used
as names and that often exhibit special syntactic properties (such as
occurring without an article in the singular in English). When other
phrases or sentences are used as names, the component words retain
their original tags. For example, in _Cat on a Hot Tin Roof_, _Cat_ is
[NOUN](), _on_ is [ADP](), _a_ is [DET](), etc.

A fine point is that it is not uncommon to regard words that are
etymologically adjectives or participles as proper nouns when they
appear as part of a multiword name that overall functions like a
proper noun, for example in _the Yellow Pages_, _United Airlines_ or
_Thrall Manufacturing Company_.  This is certainly the practice for
the English Penn Treebank tag set.

### Examples

- _Mary, John_
