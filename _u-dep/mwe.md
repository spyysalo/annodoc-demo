The multi-word expression (modifier) relation is one of the three
relations ([compound](), `mwe`, [name]()) for compounding.
It used for certain fixed grammaticized expressions with function words that behave like a single function word.

~~~ sdparse
I like dogs as well as cats
mwe(as-4, well-5)
mwe(as-4, as-6)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
He cried because of you
mwe(because, of)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Je préfère prendre un dessert plutôt qu' une entrée \n I prefer getting a dessert rather than an appetizer
mwe(plutôt, qu')
~~~

Multiword expressions are annotated in a flat, head-initial structure,
in which all words in the expression modify the first one using the
`mwe` label.
