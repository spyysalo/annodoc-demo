This relation captures pleonastic nominals. In English, this is some uses of *it* and *there*: the existential *there*, and *it* when used in extraposition constructions.  (Note that both *it* and *there* also have non-expletive uses.) An expletive or pleonastic nominal is one where the nominal does not satisfy a semantic role of the predicate. The main predicate of the clause (the verb or predicate adjective or noun) is the governor.

Some languages do not have expletives. In languages with expletives, they can be positioned where normally a core argument appears: the subject and direct object slots, as in the examples below. Note that in the analysis of these examples, we treat the postposed subject or clausal argument as a regular core argument, and mark the expletive with `expl`.

~~~ sdparse
There is a ghost in the room
expl(is, There)
nsubj(is, ghost)
nmod(is, room)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
I believe there to be a ghost in the room
nsubj(believe, I)
expl(believe, there)
xcomp(believe, be)
nsubj(be, ghost)
nmod(be, room)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
It is clear that we should decline .
expl(clear, It)
csubj(clear, decline)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
That we should decline is clear .
csubj(clear, decline)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
I mentioned it to Mary that Sue is leaving
nsubj(mentioned, I)
expl(mentioned, it)
nmod(mentioned, Mary)
ccomp(mentioned, leaving)
